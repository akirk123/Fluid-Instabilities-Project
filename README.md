# Fluid-Instabilities-Project
## Project by Adam Kirk
#### This project was kindly supervised by Dr K. Gourgouliatos
This repository contains the Python Code that I wrote for my project.

## Abstract
My project deals with the mathematics of fluid flows and the instabilities that may arise. The main focus is the linear stability analysis of the centrifugal instability in the compressible case. I derive the linear stability equations in this novel set up and I write a code to numerically solve the problem and to understand the behaviour of the fluid. I explore how changing the parameters and velocity profile affects the stability of the flow.

## In this Repository
The file Final Working Code.py gives the eigenvalues and eigenmodes for the different set-ups that are possible.
A wide range of velocity profiles can be implemented and the other parameters such as viscosity and density can be varied.

The file Rayleighcriterion.py allows the velocity profile for the flow to be checked against the modified Rayleigh Criterion
to see if the flow will be succeptible to instability.

## Version
The code in this repository was written in Enthought Canopy Version: 2.1.9.3717

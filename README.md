# Fluid-Instabilities-Project
## Project by Adam Kirk
#### This project was kindly supervised by Dr K. Gourgouliatos
This repository contains the Python Code that I wrote for my project.

The file Final Working Code.py gives the eigenvalues and eigenmodes for the different set-ups that are possible.
A wide range of velocity profiles can be implemented and the other parameters such as viscosity and density can be varied.

The file Rayleighcriterion.py allows the velocity profile for the flow to be checked against the modified Rayleigh Criterion
to see if the flow will be succeptible to instability.

# Version
The code in this repository was written in Enthought Canopy Version: 2.1.9.3717
